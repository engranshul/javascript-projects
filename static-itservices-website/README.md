This project is a static website created by using html and css.
No backend is involved in creation of this website

## How to use this project :
Just open index.html in the browser and you should be able to 
see this static website

## My Learnings from project :

css: 
* how to use . for class and # for id
* combination of id and class can be used to apply css rules
* defaults can be applied on body tag


html:
* referencing css from html in head tag
* using header tag for navigational links like aboutus,services etc
* nesting span in h1 tag
* section tag and how it helps in dividing webpage on multiple sections..
* As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a nav element, 
but a list of search results and a map display and its controls don't 
have specific elements, and could be put inside a section
* we can define form tag without action but that form wont do anything
* h1 defines largest heading and h6 defines smallest heading.
* Id is generally used when something is unique and you want to target 
that element uniquely.
